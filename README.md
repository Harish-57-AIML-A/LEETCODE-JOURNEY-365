Perfect 🔥 You want a **unique, aesthetic, iconic `README.md`** for your **UI screen overview of the total problems** (like a progress dashboard).
I’ll give you one that’s **professional, consistent, and visually attractive with emojis & sections** so it feels like a coding journal + milestone tracker.

Here’s a ready-to-use version:
